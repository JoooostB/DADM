# Data Mining & Data Analysis 
## Individual Assignment
Student: Joost Buskermolen (500709241)

Each individual student needs to show his/her data analysis and datamining skills by doing an individual assignment.This assignment is a follow-up of the assignment for the course Data Processing. For Data Mining and Data Analysis you need to build a more or less sophisticated classifier for movie reviews. The classifier should be able to classify the sentiment of the review (positive or negative).

**Itâ€™s model is built with training data from both:**

1. The dataset found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data "Kaggle") (In this case the dataset grabbed from VLO, converted to Excel for compatibility reasons.)
2. An additional (large) set of reviews from another movie review website (also through Kaggle), Rottentomatoes in this case,  [which you can find by clicking this link](https://www.kaggle.com/abhipoo/sentiment-rotten-tomatoes/downloads/sentiment-rotten-tomatoes.zip/1 "Download dataset")

**It's accuracy needs to be at least 75%**

The accuracy is around ~85% and therefore above the required minimum. Run all the cells below, and the accuracy will be printed.
